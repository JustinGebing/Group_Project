Bills-n-Stuff app
https://github.com/JustinGebing/Group_Project

For this project we have decided that we wanted to tackle an App that would be useful for everyone. What something everyone has? Bills.
There are apps out there that could help you track your bills. What we want to know is can we do it better? Our initial plan is to get
a functional app so that we can create, update and edit. We thought it would be a good idea to include, possibly an image to go along with
your bill, Just something to help you remember what something may be.  Eventually something we could add would be an API to connect 
directly with your bank account to be able to auto-populate some of these things.

On Deck:
1. Create Wireframe and Database
2. Create and Problem solve CRUD

If we have time:
-- Connect an API to link directly to a Bank Account/Database
